Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service from AWS that provides scalable virtual servers
in the cloud. 
It allows you to launch and manage instances (virtual machines) with customizable CPU, memory,
storage, and networking configurations. 
EC2 is widely used for hosting applications, websites, and running backend services, 
offering flexibility to scale up or down based on demand. 
You only pay for the compute time you use, making it a cost-efficient option for both 
short-term tasks and long-term infrastructure.
