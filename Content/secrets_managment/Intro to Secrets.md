What Are "Secrets" in DevOps?
Secrets are any sensitive pieces of data that should not be exposed publicly. Examples include:

API keys

SSH keys

Database credentials

OAuth tokens

Access tokens

TLS certificates

Cloud provider keys (AWS/GCP/Azure)

They are required for authenticating your app or deployment scripts — but must be protected from leaks.

⚠️ What Can Go Wrong?
Secrets committed to Git = Permanent exposure

Exposed secrets can lead to cloud resource hijacking, data breaches, or production takedown

Many companies have been compromised just from a leaked .env file or a hardcoded key

📌 Real-life tip: GitHub scans public repos for secrets and may auto-revoke credentials.

✅ Best Practices for Secret Management
Never commit secrets to Git

Use .gitignore for .env and config files.

Double-check before pushing: git status

Use environment variables

Define secrets in secrets section of CI/CD tools.

Access them via environment variables in scripts.

Rotate secrets regularly

Just like passwords. Automate it where possible.

Use a centralized secrets manager

Don’t store secrets in plain text files.
